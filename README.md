angular-template
================

Lightweight starter template for a angular project. Gulp is used to minify and concatinate all js-files into a single application js. This will be rebuilt on file change. This allows you to add new js-files without having to add new script-tags in your index file.

Requirements: gulp

`npm install -g gulp`

Usage:

npm install

gulp

js-files in /js/ will be compiled to appbuild folder.
